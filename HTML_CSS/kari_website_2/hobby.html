<h1>Some of my Favorite Things...</h1>

<h3>Painting</h3>
<p>I have never claimed to be a creative person and I certainly have never thought of myself as artistically gifted. I can't even draw a straight line!! But over the last few years, I have realized that I <i>enjoy</i> painting. Now I understand that being good at this hobby has nothing to do with the level of enjoyment I get from spending time painting.</p> <img src="assets/images/mountain_lake.jpeg" alt="Mountain" title="Painting of a lake with large mountains in the distance" style="float:left;width:20%;margin-left:60px" align:"left" hspace="20"/> <img src="assets/images/ocean.jpeg" alt="Ocean" title="Painting of a dark and stormy ocean scene" style="float:left;width:20%" align:"left" hspace="20"/> <img src="assets/images/autumn.jpg" alt="Autumn" title="Painting of a tree in Autumn" style="float:left;width:20%" align:"left" hspace="20"/>

<h3>Wine Tastings</h3>
<p>Don't get me wrong...sometimes wine tastings can feel stiff and snobbish - more like a funeral than an excuse to try something new. The <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vintner" target="_blank"> vintner</a> spends 5 minutes talking about the aroma, undertones, acidity, tannins, and the finish with hints of vanilla, butterfly kisses and magical fairy dust. All I know is whether I like the taste of the wine or not - and as the tasting continues, odds are I tend to like the wine more and more and more... <a href="http://www.ncwine.org/" target="_blank"> Wine tastings</a> are an adventure and a fun way to spend time with friends and family.</p>



<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>Along with her friendly smile and her huge caring heart, I also inherited my mom's love of reading. I'm addicted to <a href="http://stephenking.com" target="_blank"> Stephen King</a> and his often twisted stories. Although I still love the feel of holding a physical book and turning each page as I go, I have to admit that using my Kindle is so much more convenient!</p>
