	<h5>April 26, 2015</h5>
	<p>Going through the process of building a two-page website as homework after 4 days of the Spring Cohort at TTS Raleigh has absolutely blown my mind. I <i>think</i> I understand the concepts of HTML and CSS, but putting concepts into practice has proven a bit more challenging. Don't get me wrong...I'm not complaining! As this project has come together I have managed to confuse and amaze myself. I have hit multiple dead-ends along the way and (with the help of the plethora of information available on the internet) found solutions to those problems. I know enough to realize that my coding during this project is not <i>"pretty"</i> or efficient. But before April 20th, none of this would have <u>ever</u> been possible!!</p>


	<h5> April 23, 2015</h5>
	<p>The mind of a cat is as fascinating (and as boggling) to me as the theory of quantum physics. For example; why does Slashdot - my overweight and otherwise lazy cat decide that 3:00 am is the opportune time to go running through the house before laying down on my pillow and scratching my neck?!?!? I suppose there are things no human is meant to understand...</p> <center><img src="assets/images/slashdot.jpg" alt="Cat" title="Overweight kitty in a box" style="float:center;width:40%"  hspace="20"/></center>

	<h5> April 21, 2015</h5>
	<p>I never would have thought I'd be embarking on such an adventure at my age! Learning to code is like learning a foreign language. There is new vocabulary AND commands to commit to memory. Thankfully when I mess up the code and the page won't do what I <b><i>thought</i></b> I had clearly specified, it provides another valuable learning experience.</p>
