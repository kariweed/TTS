	<h3>The Early Years</h3>

I was born in <a href="http://www.cityofanderson.com" target="_blank"> Anderson, Indiana</a> as the youngest of three girls. Being the <i>baby</i> of the family brought many advantages. My older sisters were <b>never</b> allowed to pick on me. My mom let me eat baked apples for every single meal for three straight months because I refused everything else. We moved to Georgia when I was five and that's where most of my life was spent.

	<h3>The Formative Years</h3>

I was smart and made friends easily. I was never popular but in a small town, everyone knew everyone else. My lofty aspirations of wanting to take over the world surfaced in 8th grade and I decided to run for Freshman Class President. Much to my shock, I won...Freshman, Sophomore, Junior <b><i>and</i></b> Senior class President. I was also very involved with other activities: I was in many clubs and played the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarinet" target="_blank"> clarinet</a> in the High School Band.
