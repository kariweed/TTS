	<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi there - I'm Kari! I moved to Raleigh 3 years ago with my wonderful husband, Isaiah and our three overly-spoiled feline dependents : Scarlett, Shadow, and Slashdot.</p>

<p>I have embarked on many 'firsts' since moving to North Carolina. We bought a house which needed some TLC, so I learned more than I have ever cared to know about: replacing a bathtub, changing out tan electrical outlets for clean white ones, installing overhead lighting, removing multiple layers of obscenely tacky wallpaper, as well as painting every square inch of the house.</p>

<p>We also welcomed children into our home by becoming <a href="http://www.wakegov.com/humanservices/children/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"> Wake County Foster Parents.</a> The program is designed to help kids who are neglected, abused, and/or in an unsafe home environment. We provide a stable, loving, structured home where we help support and encourage the child's biological family. Being a foster parent is the most difficult yet rewarding thing I have ever been a part of.</p>
